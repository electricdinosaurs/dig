                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dig creates a space for the community to come together and learn about the process of growing food and our food systems through hands-on learning. Our goal is to foster the relationship between nature, humans, and fresh, healthy food. ​All levels of experience and interest are welcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The garden located in Sunset Canyon Recreation Center was first established by UCLA's largest environmental student organization, E3: Ecology, Economy, Equity, in 2006. As the garden became more demanding of its own infrastructure and leadership, Dig at UCLA was formed in 2012 as a distinct organization. Now Dig stands as a unique student group on campus that focuses on using peer learning and the garden space to educate one another about food, activism, health, and sustainability.

                                        Compost keeps our plants healthy and keeps waste out of landfills. Join one of our famous compost workshops to do it yourself, or drop off food scraps any time to the black compost bin at the end of our garden, behind the L-shaped bed.
